This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

## Getting Started with MongoDB

For those who doesn't have MongoDB account, you can simply sign up to [MongoDB]('https://www.mongodb.com/try') website.
Create new cluster and make sure you choose the free tier option and keep everything as default option.
After you have created an account and created a new cluster, navigate to Network Access from the side navigation under security and add your IP Address. Once you have added your IP Address, navigate to Database Access and create a user that has access to read and write to any database.

Before you run the development server, 
Find the code that has const client = await MongoClient.connect(''). Then, go to your cluster and click on connect and click Connect your application and copy the code from the step 2 and paste in the MongoClient.connect('').

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
